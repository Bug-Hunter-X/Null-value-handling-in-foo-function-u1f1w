# Null Value Handling Bug in JavaScript Function

This repository demonstrates a common bug in JavaScript related to null value handling and provides a solution.

## Description

The `foo` function is expected to perform some operation on the parameters `a` and `b`.  However, if either `a` or `b` is null, the function's behavior is undefined. This can lead to unexpected errors or incorrect results.

## Bug

The bug lies in the incomplete null check. While the function checks for null values, it simply returns without handling the case where null values are provided.  This could lead to unexpected errors further down the line if the function relies on `a` and `b` having defined values.

## Solution

The solution demonstrates a more robust approach to handling null values. It checks for null values and provides a default value or alternative behavior to ensure the function executes correctly even with null inputs.  This prevents unexpected errors and enhances the reliability of the code.
